<p>Welcome to the School of Computing and Information Systems at Grand Valley State University. I am pleased you
    stopped by to visit us on the web. On this site you can learn about our undergraduate majors: Computer Science
    and Information Systems, several minors, and two graduate programs: Computer Information Systems and
    Medical & BioInformatics. You can also find information on our courses, what is happening with our students,
    and also with our faculty. It is our hope that you can discover the answers to (1) why Grand Valley is the best
    university to attend, (2) why you should get a degree in computing, and (3) which major is right for you.</p>
<p>The mission of the School of Computing & Information Systems is to provide the GVSU student
    community with the intellectual foundations and experiences necessary to use information
    technology effectively in their chosen careers.</p>

<p>To enable students to attain this goal, the CIS faculty have two primary responsibilities. First, we will offer a
solid conceptual foundation required for a career in information technology. Second, we will provide direct,
experiential knowledge of the technology necessary to be a productive user/producer of information technology.</p>

                <p>Despite being the King of the North, Jon Snow is a very humble
                and just man. He gains respect through his actions and always knows
                the right thing to do. Jon is the type of person that everybody should strive to be.</p>
